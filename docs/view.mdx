# View
`View` utilizes the `View of react-native`. It is a container that 
supports the layout and is designed to be nested inside other views
and can have 0 to many children of any type 
[[1]](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/view.html).
In addition, `View` requires the use of a theme provider to be able 
to inject a theme.

## Properties of View
| **Prop**      | **Type**                   | **Default** | **Required** |
|:--------------|:---------------------------|:------------|:-------------|
| **theme**     | Shape                      | null        | Yes          |
| **classname** | String                     | ''          | No           | 
| **children**  | Node                       | null        | No           | 

Since View utilizes the `View of react-native`, it also inherits the props
of `View of react-native` (e.g. style). For the list of props of 
`View of react-native`, please see this 
[link](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/view.html).

## Basic usage of View
The following renders a View component inside another View component.
<Playground>
      <ThemeProvider>
            <View class="main_container" style={{backgroundColor: '#20B2AA'}}>
                  <NativeText>Text inside a View.</NativeText>
                  <View class="inner_container" style={{backgroundColor: '#FFB6C1'}}>
                        <NativeText>Text inside another View.</NativeText>
                  </View>
            </View>
      </ThemeProvider>
</Playground>
